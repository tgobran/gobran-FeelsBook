I need to empirically understand my feelings. So I need to record my current feelings. 
Make a simple, attractive, intuitive, mobile app to record feeings quickly. Let us call 
this app: FeelsBook. The feelings that should be supported are: 
love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness, fear
Each record of a feeling will include:
    Feeling or Emotion (categorical)
    Timestamp (presented to the users in iso8601 Date&Time format e.g. 2018-09-01T18:30:00 )
    Comment, Optional text (up to 100 characters)
Only the coment  field might be left blank for a subscription.
The app should allow the user to:
    Quickly record an emotion with only 1 click on the app and add an optional comment.
    See a count of each emotion recorded
    Browse and view the history of emotions.
    view and edit the details past emotions.
    delete a past emotion.
The history list need not show all the information for a subscription if space is limited. 
Minimally, each record in the list should show at least the date and the emotion. The history 
list must be ordered by time. The app must assist the user in proper data entry. For example, 
use appropriate user interface controls to enforce particular data types and avoid illegal 
values. The app must be persistent. That is, exiting and fully stopping the app should not 
lose data.
