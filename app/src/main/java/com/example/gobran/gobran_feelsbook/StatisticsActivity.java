/*
 * Class: Statistics Activity
 *
 * Version: 1.0
 *
 * Date: October 3rd, 2018
 *
 * Description:
 *      The activity in charge of presenting the statistics view of the app, it shows the various
 *      emotion counts for each emotion.
 * Rationale:
 *      This view presents the counts for each emotion to the user, by using a listView it allows
 *      later expandable amounts of emotions should further app development move in that direction.
 * Outstanding Issues:
 *      The view is relatively sparse now, but this issue can be remedied in the future by adding
 *      more emotions and including more data that could be presented for each emotions usage
