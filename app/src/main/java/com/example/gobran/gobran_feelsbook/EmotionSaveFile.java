/*
 * Class: EmotionSaveFile
 *
 * Version: 1.0
 *
 * Date: October 3rd, 2018
 *
 * Description:
 *      Class that handles all interactions with the android file system, both reading and writing
 *      the record data.
 * Rationale:
 *      This class allows others to not have to deal with the actual method in which records are
 *      saved. As a result it separates concerns so that a new saving system could be implemented
 *      and the rest of the model wouldn't need any changes so long as the methods functioned the
 *      same as they did before.
 * Outstanding Issues:
 *      The cost of saving or loading all records as the only option seems high, preferably in the
 *      future better saving wherein individual records could be saved would be the goal
